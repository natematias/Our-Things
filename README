== Our Things
Our Things is a web based platform which groups of people can use to coordinate the resources they share: a kitchen, a bicycle, a car, a well, or in this case, laundry.

QRCodes can be set up to point a mobile device directly to the status page for a given shared resource. The next version of Our Things will post status updates to twitter. 

Our Things uses a mobile-friendly intrerface and should work on legacy equipment. It was designed to be compatible with low-cost, repurposed equipment.

Our Things is anonymous, but since Our Things audits a community's usage history, it can help a group understand their overall usage behaviour. Further versions will include ical feeds to help communities visualise those patterns.

== Technical requirements ==
Our Things is implemented in Rails 2.3.8 because that's what I happened to have on my machine at the time. A Rails 3 conversion would be nice.
